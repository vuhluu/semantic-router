# Technical Debt

This directory contains unresolved architecture gaps only. Completed entries
are removed and remain available through Git history.

## When to Create or Update a Debt Entry

Create an entry when a concrete code or validation gap will outlive the change
that discovered it. Update it when current source changes the evidence, scope,
owner, release relevance, or exit criteria.

## What Belongs in a Debt Entry

- one unresolved gap;
- current source or gate evidence;
- why the gap matters and the desired end state;
- testable exit criteria;
- one active owner plan and release relevance.

## What Does Not Belong in a Debt Entry

- progress reports or completed work;
- branch, commit, or pull-request notes;
- daily issue state;
- operating rules that belong in governance docs;
- execution tasks that belong in a plan.

## Debt Entry Versus Other Governance Files

- Debt entry: the unresolved architecture gap.
- Execution plan: current work that owns or reduces the gap.
- Maintainer board: changing issue and pull-request state under the gitignored
  `.agent-harness/maintainer/` directory.

## Debt Entry Template

Every entry uses these sections:

- `Status`
- `Owner Plan`
- `Release Relevance`
- `Scope`
- `Summary`
- `Evidence`
- `Why It Matters`
- `Desired End State`
- `Exit Criteria`

### Unassigned

- [TD056: onnx-binding/candle-binding image resize duplication](td-056-onnx-candle-image-resize-duplication.md)

If a gap becomes release-critical, move ownership to the active release plan
and update both indexes in the same change.
