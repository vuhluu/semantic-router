# Multi Factor

## Overview

`multi_factor` ranks candidates by a configurable combination of quality,
latency, cost, and load, then rejects any candidate that violates a hard limit.

The configuration belongs to the decision that declares it. Each matched
decision uses its own weights, limits, percentile, and no-candidate policy.

## Key Advantages

- Single-decision SLO-aware routing without orchestrating multiple selectors.
- Each factor has an explicit source: quality from the release's versioned
  intelligence index, latency from observed percentiles, cost from pricing,
  and load from in-flight requests.
- Min-max normalization makes the configured weights comparable across the
  candidate set.
- No model state to train. No external service required.
- Hard SLO ceilings (TPOT, TTFT, cost, in-flight) prune unsafe candidates before scoring.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Real routes often contain a faster, cheaper model and a slower, stronger one.
The right choice depends on current observations and policy, not one fixed
metric. `multi_factor` expresses that trade-off in one decision and can remove
candidates that exceed configured limits.

## When to Use

- A decision has two or more candidates that differ in quality, latency, cost,
  or load.
- You want to enforce a latency ceiling when observations are available,
  without writing a separate decision.
- Quality, latency, cost, and load all matter and no single one dominates.

## Sibling Algorithms

- `latency_aware` is a special case of this — latency-only scoring. Use it when the other dimensions truly do not matter.
- `hybrid` combines Elo, Router-DC, and AutoMix selector scores before applying
  a cost adjustment. `multi_factor` scores configured quality and pricing plus
  observed latency and load directly.

## Algorithm Principle

For each candidate model $m$ in the candidate set, after SLO filtering:

$$\text{score}(m) = w_Q \cdot \hat{Q}(m) + w_L \cdot (1 - \hat{T}(m)) + w_C \cdot (1 - \hat{C}(m)) + w_{\text{load}} \cdot (1 - \hat{N}(m))$$

Where:

- $\hat{Q}(m)$, $\hat{T}(m)$, $\hat{C}(m)$, $\hat{N}(m)$ are quality / latency / cost / load values **min-max normalized to [0, 1] across the surviving candidate set**.
- Latency, cost, and load are inverted (`1 - ...`) because lower-is-better.
- Quality is direct because higher-is-better.
- Weights are normalized to sum to 1 (negative weights clamped to zero). Equal weights are the recoverable default.

## SLO Filtering

Before scoring, any candidate that exceeds a non-zero ceiling is removed:

- `max_tpot_ms` — p95 (or configured) TPOT observed via `pkg/latency`
- `max_ttft_ms` — p95 (or configured) TTFT observed via `pkg/latency`
- `max_cost_per_1m` — configured prompt pricing
- `max_inflight` — current in-flight request count from `pkg/inflight`

If all candidates are filtered out, behavior is controlled by `on_no_candidates`:

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `cheapest` (default) | Return the candidate with the lowest configured `prompt_per_1m` |
| `first` | Return the first candidate as listed |
| `fail` | Return an error to the caller |

## Configuration

```yaml
algorithm:
  type: multi_factor
  multi_factor:
    weights:
      quality: 0.4
      latency: 0.2
      cost: 0.2
      load: 0.2
    slo:
      max_tpot_ms: 200       # optional, omit for no ceiling
      max_ttft_ms: 800       # optional
      max_cost_per_1m: 5.0   # optional, USD per 1M prompt tokens
      max_inflight: 50       # optional
    latency_percentile: 95   # which percentile to read (default 95)
    on_no_candidates: cheapest
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `weights.quality` | float | `0.25` | Weight for an available computed model-intelligence index result |
| `weights.latency` | float | `0.25` | Weight for percentile latency (lower-is-better, inverted) |
| `weights.cost` | float | `0.25` | Weight for prompt pricing (lower-is-better, inverted) |
| `weights.load` | float | `0.25` | Weight for in-flight request count (lower-is-better, inverted) |
| `slo.max_tpot_ms` | float | `0` (off) | Hard ceiling for p95 TPOT in milliseconds |
| `slo.max_ttft_ms` | float | `0` (off) | Hard ceiling for p95 TTFT in milliseconds |
| `slo.max_cost_per_1m` | float | `0` (off) | Hard ceiling for prompt cost per 1M tokens |
| `slo.max_inflight` | int | `0` (off) | Hard ceiling for concurrent in-flight requests |
| `latency_percentile` | int | `95` | Percentile read from `pkg/latency` (1-100) |
| `on_no_candidates` | string | `cheapest` | Fallback policy when SLO filters everything: `cheapest`, `first`, `fail` |

## Known Limitations

- Quality scoring requires a comparable `available` index result. For a model
  without one, that factor is omitted and the remaining available weights are
  renormalized for that candidate.
- Min-max normalization is **per-request across the candidate set**, so absolute scale of any signal does not matter — but if all candidates have the same value on a dimension, that dimension contributes 0.5 (neutral).
- Load and latency are observed per Router process, not across the whole
  cluster. Replicas can therefore choose different candidates.
- A missing quality, latency, or cost observation omits that factor for the
  candidate and renormalizes its remaining active weights. It does not trigger
  an SLO exclusion, because absence is not evidence that the configured ceiling
  was exceeded.
